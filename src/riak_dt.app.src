  %% @See docs for erlang:term_to_binary/2. Compression can be either
  %% true | false | integer() when integer() is in a range of 0 - 9. 0
  %% is the same as false, 6 is the same as true.  The integer
  %% indicates the level of compression. Higher number means more
  %% compression, but more time to compress. In tests so far 1 has
  %% been enough for CRDTs
